# The below models were trained on pre-trained initialized weights.

# after the given epochs the model overfit, I also changed/reduced lr manually if the models were getting a bad acc on the validation

#ViT have bad acc compared to others caz 1. All layers except classifier were freezed, 2. it reqires a large amout of data to train
